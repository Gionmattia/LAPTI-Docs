## Introduction
This project was the initial introduction of the RDG concept for the accurate representation of translational complexity. This was a primarily conceptual effort however some anaylsis of Ribo-Seq data was required to identify candidates that could be used as examples in the project. 

## Project Documentation
This code has no major documentation but a brief README can be found [here](https://github.com/JackCurragh/trips_expression_exploration). This is to be run on Poitin where the processed read files of Trips-Viz can be accessed. See `/home/gwips/projects/trips_expression_exploration`
